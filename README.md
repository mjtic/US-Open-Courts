With features like court info, amount and type of courts, and the ability to view courts, the platform makes it easier for tennis players to play and connect with others in the tennis community.

# Original Idea 

Our tennis court finder and reservation website was inspired by Joel John's frustration in booking courts for his family's weekend tennis games. We developed the website to make it easy and convenient for tennis players to find and review courts near them. Our goal was to provide a valuable service to the tennis community and improve the booking process. That way more people get into the sport without all the trouble.
